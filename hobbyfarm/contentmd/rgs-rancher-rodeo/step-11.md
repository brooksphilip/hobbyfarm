In this step, we will be showing basic interaction with our Kubernetes cluster.
<br>
<br>
1. Select the "burger menu" at the top left and Click into your newly **active** cluster
<br>
<br>
Note the diagrams dials, which illustrate cluster capacity, and the box that show you the recent events in your cluster.
<br>
<br>
2. Click the **Kubectl Shell** button (the button with the Prompt icon) in the top right corner of the Cluster Explorer, and enter `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces` and observe the fact that you can interact with your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl`
<br>
<br>
3. Also take note of the **Download Kubeconfig File** button next to it which will generate a Kubeconfig file that can be used from your local desktop or within your deployment pipelines
<br>
<br>
4. In the left menu, you have access to all Kubernetes resources, the Rancher Application Marketplace and additional cluster tools
<br>
<br>
5. Proceed to the next step of this scenario
